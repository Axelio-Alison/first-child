# First Child Project: Deep Q-Learning for Portfolio Management
Hi folks, this is my first serious (and a little bit complex) project about __Reinforcement Learning__ for financial applications. Moreover, this is also a part of my Bachelor's Degree final thesis on _"Forecasting Models and Deep Q-Learning for Portfolio Management"_, a thesis in which I combine forecasting models and Reinforcement Learning techniques to create an Asset Management bot.

## Structure of the Project
The principal file on which you will find the results of my model are in the [first_child.ipynb](https://github.com/Axelio-Alison/first-child/blob/main/first_child.ipynb) file, while the files in the __Python__ directory contained functional modules for defining a custom _Trading Environment_ for portfolio management and creating a custom _D3QN Model_. 

In the Jupyter Notebook file you can find the project that contains _original_ images useful to visualize and explain the work. 
After the problem definition section, the file is divided in two sections:
1. __Data Analysis and Benchmark Creation:__ the secton in which I select the assets to use, anlyse the past returns...(Images/Assets Returns Charts.png)
