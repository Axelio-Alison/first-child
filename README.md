# First Child Project: Deep Q-Learning for Portfolio Management
Hi folks, this is my first serious (and a little bit complex) project about Reainforcement Learning for financial application. Moreover, this is also a part of my Bachelor's Degree final thesis on "Forecasting Models and Deep Q-Learning for Portfolio Management", a thesis in which I mix forecasting models and Reinforcement Learning techniques to create an Asset Management bot.

## Structure of the Project
The principal file on which you will find the results of my model are in the [first_child.ipynb](https://github.com/Axelio-Alison/first-child/blob/main/first_child.ipynb) file.
